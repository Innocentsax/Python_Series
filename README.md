As an AI language model, I do not have access to a specific Python course that you are referring to. 

***However, I can provide you with a summary of what is typically covered in a beginner-level Python course:***
* Introduction to Python: The course will start with an overview of the Python language, its history, and its uses.
Setting up the Development Environment: In this section, you will learn how to set up Python on your computer, install an integrated development environment (IDE), and how to create a Python project.
* Basic Programming Concepts: The course will cover fundamental programming concepts such as variables, data types, operators, control flow statements (if/else, loops), and functions.
* Data Structures: You will learn about lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets - which are essential in storing and manipulating data.
* Input and Output: You will learn how to get input from users and display output to the screen, as well as reading and writing data from and to files.
* Object-Oriented Programming: This section covers the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), including classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
* Modules and Libraries: In this section, you will learn about Python modules and libraries, which are reusable code that can be imported into your program.
* Web Scraping and Data Analysis: The course will cover how to use Python to extract data from websites and analyze data using popular data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

Final Project: The course will culminate with a final project that incorporates all the concepts learned in the course.
Overall, the course aims to equip you with the fundamental concepts and skills required to start programming in Python and building simple applications.
